## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at Imperial College London working in the BioPattern Printing Lab (https://bpl-imperial.github.io). My project focusses on 3D printing synthetic tissues to interact with living cells. Part of my project involves constructing the printer and software, this page will primarily focus on the software and code I develop for the printer, as well as any additional code I develop as part of my PhD. 

I am a chemist by training, so any programming help is greatly appreciated!

I can be reached via email at: r.sekhri23@imperial.ac.uk
